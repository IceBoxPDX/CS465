Hello I am Chris Teppert. At the moment I am still confused about alot of things as I am trying to get caught up with this weeks work in all my classes due to my slightly
late start to the term. I am working on a windows machine and currently in the process of getting WSL installed and setting up my enviroment. I am hoping that by tonight or
tomorrow night I will be caught up and able to start working on our class assignments.
